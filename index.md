I am a postdoctoral researcher professor in the [SerVal]() department at uni.lu. My [research interests](/research/) cover clustering, anomaly detection, map construction, and deep learning with a large focus on adversarial attacks. 
 
Before joining uni.lu, I undertook a Ph.D. opportunity at [GIlab](), University of Girona, Spain. During this period, my research focus was on clustering, anomaly detection, information theory, and data visualization. Later my research explored an industry-demanded: map construction from GPS data in the field of geographical data computing. I had a good fortune to have []() as my advisors. Furthermore, I was also involved in industrial project with the popular routing platform [WikiLoc]().

Our latest paper [An Empirical Study on Data Distribution-Aware Test Selection for Deep Learning Enhancement](/paper/TOSEM_DAT.pdf) was accepted TOSEM.
